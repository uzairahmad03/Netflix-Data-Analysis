This project explores Netflix's content catalog through detailed data analysis to uncover insights into trends, genres, and production patterns. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis covers aspects such as the distribution of movies vs. TV shows, top genres, country-wise content production, and content release trends over the years. The goal is better to understand Netflix’s global content strategy and user preferences.

## Introduction
This project dives into Netflix's dataset to uncover insights about its content library. Using Python and data visualisation tools, we explore trends in genres, content types, release years, and country distributions. The goal is to analyse patterns and understand how Netflix's content offering has evolved over time.
Interactive visualisations and summary statistics help highlight key findings, making it easier to spot content trends and regional preferences.

## About Netflix
Netflix is a global streaming service that offers a wide variety of TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content across multiple genres and languages. Founded in 1997, it has grown to become one of the world’s leading entertainment platforms, with millions of subscribers in over 190 countries.
The platform is known for its data-driven approach to content recommendations and has produced award-winning originals like Stranger Things, The Crown, and Money Heist. Its constantly evolving library reflects global viewing trends and regional preferences.

## Business Task
Netflix has established itself as a leader in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, especially in developing advanced recommendation systems that analyse customer behaviour and viewing patterns. Imagine you are in a data-focused role with access to a dataset containing over 9,000 movies. Your task is to analyse this data to answer key questions that will support Netflix in making well-informed business decisions.

Questions to Explore:

What is the most common genre of movies released on Netflix?

Which movie has the highest average vote score?

Which movie has the highest popularity, and what is its genre?

Which movie has the lowest popularity, and what is its genre?

Which year saw the highest number of movies released?

In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst tasked with examining a dataset containing over 9,000 Netflix movies. The objective is to extract meaningful insights that can help inform strategic business decisions. Through this analysis, I aim to answer important questions related to genre trends, viewer ratings, movie popularity, and yearly production patterns.
